            <h2>Recursive Functions</h2>
            <p>
            A recursive function is a function that calls itself in the function logic. Typically it is good to 
            make a recursive call conditional or it will result in an infinite loop.

            <h2>Promises</h2>
            <p>
                A Promise is a way to make asynchronous code synchronous. It is similar to asnyc/await but in my options
                it is more structured. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Each promise has a "reject" and "resolve" method provided. Typically, a promise deals mainly with "resolve". Resolves 
                is relfects the response product that is being waited for. after a promise the callback function "then()" is used to 
                access the response from the resolve.
