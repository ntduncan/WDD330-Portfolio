        <h1>Testing and Debugging</h1>
        <p>
            When developing, it is best to make sure that if your program fails that it will fail "LOUDLY."
            This will make debugging and testing much easier when you run in to errors and bugs. In production
            you should make sure that if there is a failure that the program fails silently (unless a failure is
            going to directly impact the user experience).
            Testing and debugging are used to avoid or resolve errors, exceptions, and warnings.

        <h1>Test-driven Development</h1>
        <p>
            Test driven development is the process of writing test prior to the code. The tests validate the code by 
            looking for expected outputs based on inputs. Here are the different steps in test driven development:
            <ol>
                <li>Write Tests</li>
                <li>Write code to pass the tests</li>
                <li>Refactor the code</li>
                <li>Test refactored code</li>
                <li>Write more testes for new features</li>
            </ol>
            It is really easy to ignore testing when developing code. Writing and using tests makes adding new features
            easier because it will save you more time debugging. It also helps you to think through your code more because
            you need to decide what conditions code must meet to pass a test.
